"find /somepath/ -name helloworld.py"
this will recursively search "/somepath/" for "helloworld.py"

some other useful command combination:
"find ./ -name '*.py' | xargs cat | wc -l"
this will find all the py files in current directory and count the total lines


** recursively find files bigger than some size **
find ~/tmp/ -size +10M
this will find files bigger than 10M in ~/tmp/
