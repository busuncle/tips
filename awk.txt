** all actions in awk should be quoted in single quotation, not double quotation **
eg.print the pid of the last 3 processes
we have: ps aux | tail -n 3 | awk '{print $2}', it works well as you expect
but do not input: ps aux | tail -n 3 | awk "{print $2}", it does not work at all
remember it's '{print $2}' not "{print $2}"



** use -F to specify the field-separator **
eg. awk -F"\t" '{if ($1==0} print $2;}'
this command will print the second field of every line from stdin if the first field is equal to 0


** use "dict" in awk **
eg. a file contains content below:
a 1
b 2
a 3
b 3
awk '{a[$1]+=$2}END{for(i in a) print i,a[i]}' filename
will output:
a 4
b 5
